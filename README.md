- [spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
- [spf13/viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)

Viper is used to handle configurable parameters such as network hyper parameters using env variables.

## Caution

This project has been largely abondoned and will likely get archived. For now, functional deep learning algorithms / functions are covered with tests and available in the [lib](/lib) directory.

## Still Need A NN?

- [Awesome Machine Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) has a curated list of projects, by language of choice, for Deep Learning.
